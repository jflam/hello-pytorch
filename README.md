# Experimental binder repo
*by John Lam*

This binder contains a Dockerfile that defines the computational environment for the 
single notebook that walks users through a simple E2E using pytorch starting from
a simple good-old-Python linear regression all the way to a GPU and pytorch powered
linear regression.
